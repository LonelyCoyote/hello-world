# hello-world
Following first tutorial on using github

I am retired electrical engineer.  I have developed both software and hardware solutions for the aerospace industry and the defense industry during my career.  My hobby's are PC software simulations and games.  Building micro-controller projects and working with FPGA's.  I also enjoy learning new things, I consider myself proficient in digital and analog circuit design, VHDL and software languages C#, C, and C++.

I am currently learning JavaScript, CSS and HTML using the online Khan Academy (https://www.khanacademy.org/).

I am also looking for online freelance work to perform for some extra income on the side.
